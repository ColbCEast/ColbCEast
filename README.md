My name is Colby Eastmond. I am a senior at Brigham Young University.
I am studying Applied Statistics and Analytics with a minor in
Management Information Systems. Currently, I am pursuing a career in
data science, and after graduation hope to work while I return to get a 
masters degree in data science. I enjoy sports, and frequently compete
in distance running races.
